# Protein folding and flexibility

Protein folding 

alpha helix can be formed locally, which can be more H-H bond.
beta sheet need more information to form.

Native state drive 

hydrophobic effect is the driven force

> it maybe calculate why beta sheet will from circle barrle`

White crow mean function\


water molecules can bound inside tertiary structure
(water can stay for a long time)

## Thermodynamics and protein stability
dG=G(folding)-G(unfolding). The enger is enough to fold.

A single site mutation may destabilized the whole protein
--> Good to control the celluar activity

kinetics of folding
