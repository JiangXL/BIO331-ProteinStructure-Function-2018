# Primary Structure
Amino Acid: 

peptide conformation
peptide plane: tris and cis
torsion angles: phi & psi
	tprson 

side chain has energy favor
rotamater: energetically favored conformation

Secondary Structure Turn
beta-trun : to hold the structure, they use ply and form 2 h-h bond
gamma-turn: with high energy, have 1 h-h


alpha-helix: 
beta-sheet: fully extended,
