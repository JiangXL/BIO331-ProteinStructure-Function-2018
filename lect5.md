Covalent bonds can add stability of tertiary structure

- Covant bond
- 络合物
- Cofacter

Stability is a "double-edge sword"

Variable loops in tertary strcture". Most secondary s

The loop of IGG is the area of recognize. The helix is stablity, but loop not.
so, igg has different mutation.

Interfaces, 



H-H bond is wrong, so it contribute the specaiffly.
angle and distance is important to form different H-H bond energy,
so it specifigy is high.


Water can form H-bond network


Why protein need quamtersture: to adpate more envrionment

- More r
- Specificity
- For delicate and complicate work
-


EarthWorm can have 144 helog
