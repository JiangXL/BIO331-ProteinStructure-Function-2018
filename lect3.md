# TERTIARY STRUCTURE, DOMAIN, AND MOTIF

![](assets/markdown-img-paste-20180316122055907.png)

## Protein motif
Protein motif  is a kind of super secondary structure. Both
EF-hand and Grek key are protein motif.


## Domain: compact region of protein structure
Domains are built form strutural motifs. Hydrophobic core
enhance the domain stability.

alpha domain
beta domain
alpha/beta domain


Most protein structure is samilar, but the fucntion is differnt.

alpha+beta domain

protein always bind to other structure to keep stastibility.

protein relations are very important

Cross-linked domain

beta and alpha can form many H-bond

配位键

Multi-domain proteins

Inter-domain interaction --> new framwrok --> new function

domain fold just a refernce to indicate function

Protein family


Modular nature of protein structure


Domain insertion and split domain always happern in eukaryotes
