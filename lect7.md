#Lect 7 Structure Protein

Shape, force, and dynamics

framework, connector, scaffold
fibrous protein, adhesion molecues, scaffold proteins


## Fribrou protein
- Enomous number weak interaction
- Cross-linking: covant bond


Elastin 

Cytoskeleton is the most complex


Actin: a ATPase
Structure protein also can by enzyme.
Althrough actin are ATPase, we 

We don't known how the process how ATP ro ADP influence the tuble growth

How a single cell growth to a body, the adhesion play a importan role.
