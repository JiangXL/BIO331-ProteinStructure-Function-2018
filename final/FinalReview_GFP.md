### GFP variant as pH indicator
The chromophore has pH-dependent spectral charateristics due to the ionization
of the Tyr66 phenolic group.

How they change to pKa

Both native GFP and its mutants are strongly pH dependent in aq

- GFPmull: S65T and F64L/S65T
- enhanced yellow fluoresent protien(EYFP), pKa of 7.1, suitalbe for pH measure
in pH range 6.5-7.5.

How and why fluorescent protein change with pH?
Some sensitivity to pH is natural propery of most FPs carrying either GFP-like
or DsRed-like chromophores.

In FPs with GFP-like chromophores, the proportion of charged ground-state 
chromophores grows upon an incrase in pH up to 9.0, while the proportion of
those in the protonated form diminishes.　Therefore, 480-500nm exicited with
increased pH. This fluorescence intensity change in response to pH is reversible
and very fast, occurring in <1ms.

### Ca2+ indicators
They consist of tandem fusions of a blue- or cyan-emitting mutant of the green
fluorescent protein (GFP), calmodulin, the calmodulin-binding peptide M13, and
an enhanced green- or yellow-emitting GFP.

Binding of Ca makes calmodulin wrap around the M13 domain, increasing the 
fluorescence resonance energy transfer(FRET) between the flanking GFPs. 
Calmodulin mutatins can tune the Ca2+ affiniites to measure free Ca2+
concentrations in the range 10^-8 to 10^-2 M. 

Ca2+ binding switched resulting hybrid protin(calmodulin-M13) from a dumb-bell-like
extended from to a compact globular form similar to the calmodulin-M13
intermolecular complex.

retracts and extends a long tongues(M13) into and out of the mouth of the
calmodulin.
