# Phosphorylation

## Why choose PO4 

PO_4 中的氧可以形成 H-H bond

+ Salt bridge= H-H and Charge interaction
+ Form new interaction to form new bound site
+ Destruction existence interaction

Reason:

+ Phosphroylation is reversible

Phosphorylation can be a switch. 



To change the activity,:

phosphorylation can modulate protein activities by inducing large conformation changes.
